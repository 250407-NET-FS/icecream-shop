# Cart's Icecream Shop
## Executive Summary
This project gives a brief overview of "Cart's Icecream Shop", created on April 10, 2025, with the goal of creating a digital icecream shop with user accessibility. The project meets to satisfy user taste while upholding a business structure.

Key functionalities include setting a price for custom-made icecream and adding transactions based on the orders made. Customers can order and customize a select number of icecream; cashiers create transactions to save orders and start purchases with the customers.

The proposed development approach utilizes a waterfall methodology, ensuring productivity and iterative progress with feedback integration anticipates completing the service by April 18, 2025. A brief demo is scheduled for the due date, with the full system go-live to be discussed.

Potential risks identified include the storage of personal information for both our staff and customers. Mitigation strategies, including necessary security implementations in a dedicated database, will be in place to address these risks.

The project aims to deliver a high-quality, impactful solution that meets the strategic objectives of the organization. We look forward to the opportunity to partner with you on this transformative initiative.
